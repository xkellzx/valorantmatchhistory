After requesting my data from Riot Games, I decided to play around a bit with the data files by creating visualizations in Tableau.

Most of the data given was about my account information, including summoner's name, purchase history, and player reports. I took interest in the Valorant match history file.

This dataset shows every single Valorant match I have played. It tells the start and end time, game mode, and game outcome. Using these parameters, I used Tableau to visualize my match history.

The first visualization is a pie chart showing the proportions of which game modes I play the most. The second visualization showcases the win/lose rate of each game mode. 

With the Tableau dashboard, you can click on a section of the pie chart to filter the stacked bar chart on the right, so that it only shows the one chosen game mode. Using the date dropdown menu, you can also filter the pie chart and stacked bar chart to only show data from one specific day.
